# AR Gốm Sứ

## Introduction
A project I worked with a friend (Chu Quynh Anh) from FPT Greenwich University about implementing AR technology to pottery business.  
The app makes use of Vuforia for image tracking and plane detection.  
All the UI design and 3D models are made by my friend and her group.  

## Supported platforms
- Android

## About the app
The app has 3 basic functionalities:
- Browsing the store and available pottery product (not fully functional and is only served as a demonstration)  
- Showing true-size 3D model of the pottery item that customers want to preview in their house, table, etc...  
- Play AR animation on a real-life pottery item.  

Also user can take a shot of the AR screen to their phone.
